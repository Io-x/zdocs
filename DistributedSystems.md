1.  A system of clocks satisfying the clock condition can be used to order the events of a
    system based on what happened before the relationship among the events. In the context of
    clock synchronization, describe:

            i. The role ofa distributed operating system designer.
            ii.The three main componentsof a computer clock.

2.  Define the following terms as used in a distributed system;

        i. Bully algorithm
        i. Remote Procedure Call

3.  Web services in cloud computing can be found and invoked over the network. Explain
    how can you ensure that your web service remains active even if there is a hardware or
    software issue.

4.  Selection of Victim is an approach used to choose processes broken by killing or rolled
    back during deadlock. These processes are called victims. Selection of victim(s) is based
    on two major factors. Introspect these `two` factors.

5.  Security is a major factor in implementation of distributed systems. Explain the public key mechanisms in distributed systems stating their advantages.

6.  Distributed systems have endless use cases, a few being electronic banking systems. Explain three major types of security threats facing e-banking systems.

7.  Explain three reasonswhy synchronizationis needed in a distributed system

8.  Distributed systems enable different areas of a business to build specific applications to support their needs. Discuss three major characteristics that such applications must
    possess.

9.  Election algorithms are meant for electing to take coordinator process from anmong the
    currently running processesin such a manner that at any instance of time there is a single
    coordinator for all processes in the system. Examine `three` main assumptions on which
    election algorithms are based.

10. There are several resources in a system that must not be used simultaneously by multiple
    processes if program operation is to be correct. Otherwise,this may lead to a deadlock.

            i. Define a deadlock.
            ii. Explain two necessary conditions which lead to a deadlock.
            iii. Explain two important issues in recovery from deadlock.

11. Middlevware in an integral part of any distributed system. Define the term middleware and explain the major roles of middleware in distributed systems.

12. A distributed shared memory system implements the shared-memory model on a physically
    distributed memory system.

            i. Define distributed shared memory.
            ii. Explain differences between shared and distributed memory systems.
            iii. Discuss four advantages of distributed shared memory.

13. Consider that Zetech Digital System is implemented in a distributed environment. List and explain `FIVE` possible types of transparencies needed to be incorporated in this system.
    Justify your answer.

14. Distributed algorithms require that there be a coordinator process in the entire system that performs some type of coordination activity needed for the smooth running of
    other processes in the system.

            i. Discuss two electionalgorithms that are used in selecting acoordinating
            process.
            ii. Highlight three assumptions that the election algorithms are based on.

15. A Distributed File System, is a file system that is distributed on multiple file servers
    or multiple locations. Describe `two` types of distributed file systems

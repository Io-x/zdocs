6.  Which PHP functions are used to achieve the following with MySQL database server on the local machine? Use example to show how each is implemented

    i. Connect to the server with username `root` and password `zu_pw0l`
    ii. Select a database called `zu_db002` to be used for queries
    iii. Execute a query select all rows and columns from the table `zu_users`

7.  Using a well labelled diagram of web communication architecture to answer the following questions:

    i. Describe webserver-client communication

    ii. Distingush between the HTTP Request and Response

8.  Using Examples, explain what you understand by the following in relation to web applications;

    i. Content management systems(CMS)

    ii. Framework

9.  You are required to write codes to validate the form before submission to the server for processing. Write source codes to validate the form fields as follows:

    i. Validate the password field to ensure it is at least 8 characters long

    ii. Validate the email address provided and print the error message "`Email is required`” when email has not been provided

    i. State and explain any three good reasons for companies to build web applications.

    ii. Explain web application development process, which provides a good outline for a web applicaion lifecycle process

12. As a PHP programmer, develop a form that sends your registration number and phone number to a PHP file called `contact.php`. In this PHP file, capture and display the phone number received from the form.

13. Use a PHP script to demonstrate an Array that stores THREE flavors of LINUX namely `Redhat, Suse & Kali`. The flavors should be received from the user interactively.

14. Cookies in websites are used to identify users. Write a PHP script that creates a cookie called `myUser` with the value `Server Side`. The cookie should expire in 20 days.

15. Zetech University intends to sensitize its website users (Student and Staff portals) on possible security attacks. Describe three such attacks and ways of dealing with the attacks.

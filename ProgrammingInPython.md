1.  Define the following terms as used in object-oriented programming;

        i) Abstraction
        ii)Inheritance

2.  Write a python program to assign a discount of 8% if amount of purchase exceeds KSh 5000. Prompt the user to enter te amount of purchase

3.  Create a list named `courses` with five items(SCT, BCS, BBI,BE and BCOM). Use the relevaNt method to reverse the items in the list. Finally print `courses`.

4.  A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Explain any three benefits of functions in a computer program.

5.  Write a python function to determine if any given number is even or odd.

6.  Given that the value of a variable `x = 8` and `y =5`. State the output when each of the following statements as executed in python;

        i) x *= 2
        ii) x//3
        ii) x == y
        iv) y %= 3
        v) x += 9

7.  A bank will offer a customer a loan if they are 21 years or over and have an annual income of at least Sh.33000. The customers age and income are input in response to user friendly prompts. Create a python program to implement the above requirements.

        i) Ask user for their salary and years of service
        ii) Compute and print the net bonus amount as per the requirements stipulated above.

9.  Python has various standard data types that are used to define the operations possible on them and the storage for each of them. Using examples explain five data types used in python.

10. Write a python program that determines whether a person is eligible to vote based on the following conditions:

            i) The person must be a citizen of one of the East African conutries : Kenya , Uganda or Tanzania.

    Your task is to implement a python program according to the given conditions . The program should prompt the user to enter their citizenship, age and a national ID and then output an appropraite message.

11. Create a dictionary named `personalDetails` with the following information;

12. Given the following list `list = ['physics','chemistry','statistics','2020']`. Write the output of the following code:

        i) list[1:3]
        ii) list[0]
        iii) list[-1]
        iv) list.remove('chemistry')
        v) list.append('biology')

13. You have been hired to develop a simple banking system in Python using object-oriented programming principles. Design and implement a class called `BankAccount` that represents a basic bank account.
    The class should have the following attributes and methods;

#### Attributes:

i) `account_number`: a string representing the account number.
ii) `account_holder`: a string representing the account holder's name.
iii) `balance`: a float representing the current balance of the account.

Use the **init** method to initialize the attributes of the `BankAccount` class.

#### Methods:

i) `deposit(amount)`: a method that takes a float amount as input and adds it to the account's balance.
ii) `withdraw(amount)`: a method that takes a float amount as input and subtracts it from the account's balance if sufficient funds are available.
iii) `get_balance()`: a method that returns the current balance of the current the account.
iv)`display_account_info()`: a method that displays the account number, account holder's name and current balance of the account.

Using the `BankAccount` class, create one instance of the bank account. Perform the following operations: deposit, withdraw and display account information for the `BankAccount` instance.

# SIMULATION AND MODELLING

1.  Differentiate the following terms:

            i) Mixed congruential and multiplicative congruential methods
            ii) Arrival time and effective arrival time
            iii) Parameters and Hyper parameters

2.  Discuss two methods of testing random numbers.

3.  Draw a compartmental model of how disease spreads among a population with at least five compartments and their general equations.

4.  Explain a recent case where simulators have shown that they can be used to train individuals for real world situations.

5.  Arrivals at a car wash are considered to be poison at an average time of 8 min between an arrival and the next. The length it takes to wash a car is distributed exponntially, with a mean of 4 min. Determine:

        i) Expected fraction of the day that the phone will be in use.
        ii) Expected number of units in the queue expceted waiting time in the queue.
        iii) Expected number of units in the system.

6.  Complete the table below:

    | System            | Customers | Server(s) |
    | ----------------- | --------- | --------- |
    | Education         |           |           |
    | Hospital          |           |           |
    | Telecommunication |           |           |
    | Banking           |           |           |

7.  Draw the flow chart, illustrating the steps followed in the simulation study.

8.  Discuss the main components of queueing system.

9.  Taking the number 1 as the seed, a = 16, c = 18 and m = 23, generate five random numbers using the mixed congruential method of generating random nummbers.

10. Discuss when simulation is not an appropriate tool to use.

11. Explain why animation is appropriaete in explaining the behaviour of a model when it is completed.

12. Consider a falling ball of mass 616 grams from a height of 20m that hits a concrete pavement. Assuming that there is no wind resistance and no energy is lost during impact;

        i) Draw a conceptualize model to present the system
        ii) Discuss all the parameters to consider in order to simulate the system
        iii) Develop a mathematical model to represent the system
        iv) What type of event simulation is this. Discuss.
        v) Write code to implement the system

13. Consider a single server queueing system. The system starts at time t=0. The arrival time of customers is: `0.8, 1.4,2.7, 3.2, 3.8, 8.0, 8.6, 9.0, 9.3 and 9.8`. The departure times are: `2.2, 4.0, 5.0, 6.2, 10.0, 12.3, 14.5, 17.0, 17.9 and 20.3`. The times are in minutes. The FIFO disciplines is followed, hence:

        i) Manually simulate the system.
        ii) Compute average time a customer waits in the system.
        iii) The probability that the server will be busy.
        iv) The expected of utilization of the server.

14. What are the properties of a pseudo random number?

15. Given the sequence of numbers: 0.54, 0.73, 0.98, 0.11 and 0.68, should the hypothesis that these numbers are uniformly distributed on the interval [0,1] be rejected using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test at the $\alpha$=0.05 significance level, where the critical value for N=5 is 0.565?

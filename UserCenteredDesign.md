# USER-CENTERED DESIGN

1. Discuss how the following terminologies apply to User-Centered design:

- i. Ethnographic research

- ii. Human Centric approach

- iii. User Interface experience

2. Expound on TWO communication challenges in the process of user centered design

3. Enumerate FOUR key stakeholders that you would consider important for smooth execution of a User Centered Design Project

4. Describe THREE Prototyping techniques you could employ in development of User Centered application

5. Differentiate between Graphic Design and User Centered Design

6. You are tasked with developing and deploy a web-based application for use in a small company;

- i. Describe what an ethnographic approach is in the context of User Interface Design

- ii. Describe TWO advantages of using an ethnographic approach in this task

7. Farmers League, a global leader in digital agriculture, utilized design thinking principles to develop precision agriculture solutions tailored to the needs of farmers. By empathizing with farmers and understanding their pain points, such as unpredictable weather, soil variability, and input costs, Farmers Edge designers and agronomists co-created innovative tools and technologies to improve farm efficiency and productivity. Through collaborative workshops and field trials, Farmers League developed solutions such as predictive analytics for crop management, variable rate technology for precise input application, and remote sensing for early detection of crop stress. This user-centric approach not only empowered farmers to make data-driven decisions but also enhanced sustainability and profitability in agriculture.

- i. Discuss FIVE golden rules of good interface design according to Ben Schneiderman, appropriate in developing interfaces for the systems used by Farmers League

- ii. Discuss any FIVE theories of Information Systems and how they relate to development of interfaces for the systems used by Farmers League

8. With relevant examples, discuss the FIVE phases of Design Thinking as used in User Centered Design process

9. Discuss FIVE mechanisms of enforcing security when designing a user centered interface.

10. Kanyagia, the nonprofit arm of a design consultancy company which has partnered with organizations to address challenges faced by smallholder farmers in rural communities. Applying human-centered design principles, Kanyagia designers immersed themselves in the lives of farmers, understanding their needs, aspirations, and constraints. Through co-design workshops and prototyping sessions, Kanyagia collaborated with farmers to develop solutions such as low-cost irrigation systems, weather-resistant storage facilities, and market linkages for selling produce. By prioritizing farmer input and involving them in the design process, Kanyagia created solutions that were not only technologically appropriate but also culturally relevant and sustainable.

- i. Analyze TWO ways in which you can achieve productivity of engaging users in the User Centered design process of this project

- ii. Discuss the User Centered Design principles as used in the project above

- iii. Discuss TWO assumptions you would make in the above project

- iv. Discuss TWO pitfalls likely to happen in the above project

## Use of LaTeX

Certain files within this repository, such as [Calculus.md](./Calculus.md) and [DiscreteMaths.md](./DiscreteMaths.md), contain LaTeX syntax.

If you're accessing this repository on a mobile app and encounter difficulties viewing some questions, especially `No.5 & 15` in [Calculus.md](./Calculus.md), it is recommended to view the repository in a browser.

In cases where LaTeX rendering is not supported in the browser, you can copy and paste the specific question or equation into an AI Assistant like ChatGPT. This ensures you can still access and understand the unrendered syntax.
